# fullMvpTickets.md — GRIOT MVP Remaining Tickets

## Project Rule

Read `codexInstructions.md` before every task.

Do only the assigned ticket.
Do not implement future tickets early.
Do not redesign the UI unless the ticket explicitly asks for it.
After each task, summarize:

- files changed
- what was implemented
- how to test

---

# Current Status

Already implemented:

1. Supabase post persistence
2. Backend-driven feed
3. Removed local fake `addRecording` flow
4. `/saved` screen MVP
5. `/my-voices` screen MVP

Current stack:

- Expo / React Native
- Expo Router
- Zustand
- Supabase DB
- Cloudinary uploads

# Ticket 6 — Add Geolocation Permission + Capture

## Goal

Capture the user’s location when they record a voice.

## Requirements

1. Install and use `expo-location`.
2. Request foreground location permission.
3. When a user creates a post, capture:
   - `latitude`
   - `longitude`

4. Include those values in the Supabase `createPost()` payload.
5. If permission is denied, still allow posting with `latitude` and `longitude` as `null`.
6. Do not block recording if location fails.
7. Add clear logs:
   - location granted
   - location denied
   - location capture failed

## Do Not

- Do not build map UI.
- Do not add location search.
- Do not add reverse geocoding yet.

## Test

- Record a voice.
- Confirm Supabase row contains latitude and longitude.
- Deny permission and confirm post still works.

# Ticket 7 — Fetch Nearby Feed

## Goal

Use location to prioritize nearby posts.

## Requirements

1. Add a `getNearbyPosts()` service function.
2. Use the current user location if available.
3. For MVP, fetch all posts from Supabase and sort client-side by distance.
4. Add a small distance helper:
   - input: user lat/lng + post lat/lng
   - output: distance in miles or km

5. Populate `distance` on `AudioPost`.
6. Feed should still work if no location is available:
   - fallback to latest posts

## Do Not

- Do not create PostGIS functions yet.
- Do not optimize database geo queries yet.
- Do not add map UI.

## Test

- Create posts with coordinates.
- Confirm closer posts appear first.
- Confirm no-location fallback still loads feed.

# Ticket 8 — Lightweight Local Profile

## Goal

Give the user a basic identity without full auth.

## Requirements

1. Add local profile state to Zustand:
   - username
   - avatar
   - town
   - neighborhood

2. Create `/profile` screen.
3. Allow user to edit:
   - username
   - town
   - neighborhood

4. Persist profile locally using Zustand persist or AsyncStorage.
5. Use profile values when creating posts.
6. If no profile exists, use safe defaults.

## Do Not

- Do not add Supabase Auth.

# Ticket 9 — Persist Views

## Goal

Views should update in Supabase, not only locally.

## Requirements

1. Add `incrementPostViews(postId)` in `postService.ts`.
2. When a post becomes active, increment views.
3. Prevent excessive increments in one session:
   - track viewed post IDs locally in memory
   - only increment once per app session per post

4. Update local Zustand state optimistically.

## Do Not

- Do not add per-user view tracking.
- Do not add analytics table yet.

## Test

4. Persist the increment to Supabase.
5. Keep multiple taps allowed for MVP.

## Do Not

- Do not add per-user reaction limits.

# Ticket 11 — Persist Saves Locally

## Goal

Saved posts should survive app reload.

Suggested copy:

Feed:
“No voices nearby yet.”
“Be the first to speak.”

Saved:
“Aucune voix sauvegardée.”
“Les voix que tu veux retrouver vivront ici.”

# Final MVP Definition

GRIOT MVP is complete when:

1. User can open app and hear backend-loaded voices.
2. User can record and publish a voice.

5. Feed loads from Supabase.
6. User can save voices locally.
7. User can see their own voices locally.
8. App captures location when available.
9. Feed prioritizes nearby voices.
10. Basic reactions and views persist.
11. App has minimal safety reporting.
12. App survives restart without losing core user state.

# Important Reminder

Do not build authentication until after this MVP is stable.

Auth comes after the anonymous/local identity loop works.
